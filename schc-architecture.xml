<!--- (compiled with:  "kdrfc schc-architecture.md" ) -->

<t>The IETF LPWAN WG defined the necessary operations to enable IPv6 over
selected Low-Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) radio technologies.
<xref target="rfc8376"/> presents an overview of those technologies.</t>

<t>The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) <xref target="rfc8724"/> technology is the core
product of the IETF LPWAN working group and was the basis to form the SCHC
Working Group.
<xref target="rfc8724"/> defines a generic framework for header compression and fragmentation,
based on a static context that is pre-installed on the SCHC endpoints.</t>

<t>This document details the constitutive elements of a SCHC-based solution, and
how the solution can be deployed. It provides a general architecture for a SCHC
deployment, positioning the required specifications, describing the possible
deployment types, and indicating models whereby the rules can be distributed and
installed to enable reliable and scalable operations.</t>

(SoV).</t>
  <t>SCHC Instance.  The session between SCHC end-points in two or more
peer nodes operating SCHC to communicate using a common SoR and a
matching SoV. There are at least two SCHC Instances involved per SCHC stratum,
one SCHC Control Instance that manages the SCHC Control Header 
to discriminate the SCHC Data Instance(s) and 
one or more SCHC Data Instance(s) that handle(s) the SCHC Data Header,
for, e.g., compression and decompression operations.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="building-blocks"><name>Building Blocks</name>
<t>This section specifies the principal blocks defined for building and using the SCHC architecture in any network topology and protocol.</t>

<section anchor="schc-stratum-plural-strata"><name>SCHC Stratum (plural: strata)</name>

<t>A SCHC Stratum is the SCHC analoguous to a classical layer in the IP architecture, but its operation may cover multiple IP layers or only a subset of a layer, e.g., IP only, IP+UDP, CoAP, or OSCORE <xref target="rfc8824"/>. The term stratum is thus used to avoid confusion with traditional layers. Also, SCHC Strata are not stacked, though they can be nested.</t>

<t>The SCHC Stratum data in a datagram is composed of a SCHC Control Header (which may be compressed to the point that it is fully implicit and thus elided), a SCHC Data Header (that is used to uncompress a section of the SCHC datagram), and possibly some remaining payload that is unaffected by the SCHC Stratum. The SCHC Stratum operation requires at least 2 end-points, one for the SCHC Control Header and one or more for the SCHC Data Header.</t>

<t>A SCHC datagram may contain additional stratum data, to be handled by sequential (nested) SCHC Strata, where the inner (nested) Stratum operates within the decompressed/reassembled payload of the outter (nesting) Stratum.</t>

<!--
The SCHC operation concatenates fragments and swaps the stratum data with the uncompressed payload obtained from the SCHC datagram residue. 
-->

<t>A SCHC Stratum is instantiated in participating nodes as a pair of SCHC end-points, and matching SCHC end-points in communicating nodes are associated to form a SCHC end-point. 
A SCHC end-point may be Point to point (P2P), or Point to Multipoint. 
A P2MP SCHC end-point is unidirectional, meaning that all the SCHC datagrams are generated by the same node. 
A P2P SCHC end-point may be unidirectional or bidirectional, symmetrical (between peers) or asymetrical (between a device and an application).</t>

<t>A SCHC end-point operates datagram fragmentation and/or data compression and decompression, and maintains the state and timers associated with the Stratum operation over the consecutive datagrams or fragments.</t>

<t>The SCHC end-points that handle the compression for nested Strata might differ for the same datagram, meaning that the payload of a given Stratum might be compressed/uncompressed by a different entity, possibly in a different node. It results that the degree of compression (the number of Strata) for a given datagram may vary as the datagram progresses through the layers inside a node and then through the network.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discriminator"><name>Discriminator</name>

<t>The key to determine how to decompress a SCHC Control Header in a stratum is called a Discriminator.</t>

<t>The Discriminator is typically extrinsic to the stratum data.</t>

<t>It may be found in the datagram context, e.g., the ID of the interface, VLAN, SSID, or PPP SCHC Instance on which the datagram is received.</t>

<t>It may also be received in the datagram, natively or uncompressed from a nesting stratum, e.g.:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A source and destination MAC or IP addresses of the datagram
carrying SCHC datagrams</t>
  <t>A source and destination port number of the transport layer
carrying SCHC datagrams</t>
  <t>A next header field</t>
  <t>An MPLS label</t>
  <t>A TLS Association</t>
  <t>Any other kind of connection id.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The Discriminator enables to determine the SCHC end-point that is used to decompress the SCHC Control Header, called a SCHC Control end-point.</t>

<t>Once uncompressed, the SCHC Control Header enables to determine the SCHC end-point, called a SCHC Data end-point, that is used to restore the datagram data that is compressed in the stratum.</t>

<!--
A SCHC Layer is a building block composed at least of a SCHC Data end-point as described in the {{rfc8724}}. A SCHC Control end-point may be added, it controls the SCHC Layer. The SCHC Control end-point is used with different SCHC datagrams end-points if they are defined in the same SCHC Layer.

Note that a SCHC Layer is different from an ISO layer {{Fig-SCHCInstance}}. 
-->

</section>
<section anchor="schc-control-end-point"><name>SCHC Control End-Point</name>

<t>The SCHC Control end-point manages the SCHC Control Headers and provides the information and the selection of a SCHC Data end-point.</t>

<t>The rules for that end-point might be such that all the fields in the SCHC Control Header are well-known, in which case the header is fully elided in the stratum data and recreated from the rules.</t>

<t>The rules might also leverage intrinsic data that is found in-line in the stratum data, in which case the first bits of the stratum data are effectively residue to the compression of the SCHC Control Header. 
Finally, the rules may leverage extrinsic data as the Discriminator does.</t>

<!--
A SCHC Control Header is mandatory in a stratum and can be free of charge for very constrained networks such as LPWAN. It allows the recognition of SCHC as the next header and can give the protocol that SCHC has compressed.
-->

<t><xref target="Fig-SCHCInstance"/> illustrates the case where a given stratum may compress multiple protocols SCHC Instances, each corresponding to a different SCHC Data end-point.</t>

<!--
shows the SCHC strata that needs to be introduced in the Architecture when SCHC is used to compress different protocols together or independently as {{rfc8824}} has described for CoAP. Notice that the parenthesis in the figure indicates a SCHC compression.

Each SCHC Data end-point uses its own Set of Rules,
but share the same SCHC Control Header.

<section anchor="schc-control-header"><name>SCHC Control Header</name>

<t>The SCHC Control Header carries information that is required for the SCHC strata operation. For example, it selects the correct end-point and checks the validity of the datagram.
There IS NOT always a RuleID if there is only one Rule for the SCHC Control Header, whose length is 0. The SCHC Control Header format is not fixed, and the SoR MUST have one or more Rules describing the formats. SCHC Control Header contains different fields.
For the end-point, if the SCHC Control Header identifies, e.g., the next protocol in the stack, the format of the SCHC Control Header may be represented as shown in <xref target="Fig-SCHCHDR"/>.</t>

<figure title="Example of SCHC Control Header Format and the corresponding Rule" anchor="Fig-SCHCHDR"><artwork><![CDATA[
Non-compressed SCHC Control Header Format:

SCHC Control Header Compressed:
+- - - - -+- - - - - - - - - - +
| Rule ID | Compressed Residue |
+- - - - -+- - - - - - - - - - +

<t>In this example the Rule defines:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A SCHC InstanceID is 10 bits length and it is used to identify the SoR used for this end-point of SCHC.</t>
  <t>A Protocol ID in 1-byte length giving the value send in the layer below the SCHC datagram to identify the uncompressed protocol stack.</t>
  <t>And A CRC. The CRC field is 8 bits length and covers the SCHC Control Header and the SCHC datagram from error. When it is elided by the compression, the layer-4 checksum MUST be replaced by another validation sequence.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="end_points"><name>SCHC Data End-Point</name>
<t>A SCHC Data end-point handles this node's side of a SCHC Data instance?
It is characterized by a particular SoR common with the corresponding distant end-point.
The <xref target="rfc8724"/> defines a protocol operation between a pair of peers.
In a SCHC strata, several SCHC end-points may contain different SoR.</t>

<t>When the SCHC Device is a highly constrained unit, there is typically only one
end-point for that Device, and all the traffic from and to the device is
exchanged with the same Network Gateway. All the traffic can thus be implicitly
associated with the single end-point that the device supports, and the Device
does not need to manipulate the concept. For that reason, SCHC avoids to signal
explicitly the end-point identification in its data datagrams.</t>

<t>The Network Gateway, on the other hand, maintains multiple end-points, one per
SCHC Device. The end-point is derived from the lower layer, typically the source
of an incoming SCHC datagram as a discriminator in the <xref target="Fig-SCHCInstance"/>.
The end-point is used in particular to select the set of rules that apply to the SCHC Device, and the
current state of their exchange, e.g., timers and previous fragments.</t>

<section anchor="schc-data-header"><name>SCHC Data Header</name>

<t>As defined in section 5.1 of <xref target="rfc8724"/>, a SCHC datagram (or packet) is composed of the compressed header called the SCHC Data Header followed by the uncompressed remainder payload from the original datagram (or packet).
The SCHC Data Header, contains the data  generated by the SCHC operation. It is composed of a RuleID followed by the content described in the Rule. 
The content may be a C/D datagram, a F/R datagram, a CORECONF_Management or a Non Compressed datagram.</t>

<figure title="SCHC Datagram" anchor="Fig-SCHCdatagram"><artwork><![CDATA[

<section anchor="schc-profiles"><name>SCHC Profiles</name>
<t>A SCHC profile is the specification to adapt the use of SCHC with the necessities of the technology to which it is applied.
In the case of star topologies and because LPWAN technologies <xref target="rfc8376"/> have strict yet distinct constraints, e.g., in terms of maximum frame size, throughput, and directionality, also a SCHC end-point and the fragmentation model with the parameters' values for its use.</t>

<t>Appendix D. "SCHC Parameters" of <xref target="rfc8724"/> lists the information that an LPWAN
technology-specific document must provide to profile SCHC fragmentation for that technology.</t>

<t>As an example, <xref target="rfc9011"/> provides the SCHC fragmentation profile for LoRaWAN networks.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="schc-operation"><name>SCHC Operation</name>
<t>The SCHC operation requires a shared sense of which SCHC Device is Uplink
(Dev to App) and which is Downlink (App to Dev), see <xref target="rfc8376"/>.
In a star deployment, the hub is always considered Uplink and the spokes are
Downlink. The expectation is that the hub and spoke derive knowledge of their
role from the network configuration and SCHC does not need to signal which is
hub thus Uplink vs. which is spoke thus Downlink. In other words, the link
direction is determined from extrinsic properties, and is not advertised in the
protocol.</t>

<t>Nevertheless, SCHC is very generic and its applicability is not limited to
star-oriented deployments and/or to use cases where applications are very static
and the state provisioned in advance.
In particular, a peer-to-peer (P2P) SCHC end-point (see <xref target="end_points"/>) may be set
up between peers of equivalent capabilities, and the link direction cannot be
inferred, either from the network topology nor from the device capability.</t>

<t>In that case, by convention, the device that initiates the connection that
sustains the SCHC end-point is considered as being Downlink, i.e. it plays the
role of the Dev in <xref target="rfc8724"/>.</t>

<t>This convention can be reversed, e.g., by configuration,
but for proper SCHC operation, it is required that the method used ensures that
both ends are aware of their role, and then again this determination is based
on extrinsic properties.</t>

<section anchor="schc-rules"><name>SCHC Rules</name>
<t>SCHC Rules are a description of the header protocols fields, into a list of Field Descriptors. The <xref target="rfc8724"/> gives the format of the Rule description for C/D, F/R and non-compression. In the same manner the SCHC Control Header and SCHc CORECONF_Management will use the <xref target="rfc8724"/> field descriptors to compress the format information.</t>

<t>Each type of Rule is identified with a RuleID. There are different types of Rules: C/D, F/R, SCHC Control Header, CORECONF_Management and No Compression. Notice that each Rule type used an independent range of RuleID to identify its rules.</t>

<t>A Rule does not describe how the compressor parses a datagram header. Rules only describe the behavior for each header field.</t>

<t><xref target="rfc9363"/> defines a YANG data model to represent the rules. This enables the use of several protocols for rule management, such as NETCONF<xref target="RFC6241"/>, RESTCONF<xref target="RFC8040"/>, and CORECONF<xref target="I-D.ietf-core-comi"/>. NETCONF uses SSH, RESTCONF uses HTTPS, and CORECONF uses CoAP(s) as their respective transport layer protocols. The data is represented in XML under NETCONF, in JSON<xref target="RFC8259"/> under RESTCONF and in CBOR<xref target="RFC8949"/> under CORECONF.</t>

<t>The Rule Manager (RM) is in charge of handling data derived from the YANG Data
Model and apply changes to the context and SoR of each SCHC end-point <xref target="Fig-RM"/>.</t>

<t>The RM is an Application using the Internet to exchange information, therefore:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>for the network-level SCHC, the communication does not require routing. Each of the end-points having an RM and both RMs can be viewed on the same link, therefore wellknown Link Local addresses can be used to identify the Device and the core RM. L2 security MAY be deemed as sufficient, if it provides the necessary level of protection.</t>
  <t>for application-level SCHC, routing is involved and global IP addresses SHOULD be used. End-to-end encryption is RECOMMENDED.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Management messages can also be carried in the negotiation protocol, for instace, the <xref target="I-D.ietf-schc-over-ppp"/> proposes a solution.
The RM traffic may be itself compressed by SCHC: if CORECONF protocol is used, <xref target="rfc8824"/> can be applied.</t>

<section anchor="schc-architecture"><name>SCHC Architecture</name>

<t>As described in <xref target="rfc8824"/>, SCHC  combining several SCHC end-points.
The <xref target="rfc8724"/> states that a SCHC end-point needs the rules to process C/D and F/R before the SCHC Instance starts and that the SoR of the end-point control layer cannot be modified. However, the rules may be updated in certain end-points to improve the performance of C/D, F/R, or CORECONF_Management. The <xref target="I-D.ietf-schc-access-control"/> defines the possible modifications and who can modify, update, create and delete Rules or part of them in the end-points' SoR.</t>

<t>As represented in <xref target="Fig-SCHCCOAP2"/>, the compression
of the IP and UDP headers may be operated by a network SCHC end-point whereas the
end-to-end compression of the application payload happens between the Device and
the application. The compression of the application payload may be split in two
end-points to deal with the encrypted portion of the application PDU. Fragmentation
applies before LPWAN transmission layer.</t>

<t>This document defines a generic architecture for SCHC that can be used at any of these levels.
The goal of the architectural document is to orchestrate the different protocols and data model
defined by the LPWAN and SCHC working groups to design an operational and interoperable
framework for allowing IP application over constrained networks.</t>

<t>The <xref target="Fig-SCHCArchi"/> shows the protocol stack and the corresponding SCHC stratas enabling the compression of the different protocol headers.
The SCHC Control Header eases the introduction of intermediary host in the end-to-end communication transparently.
All the SCHC Control Headers are compressed and in some cases are elided, for example for LPWAN networks. The layers using encryption does not have a SCHC Control Header in the middle because they are the same entity.
<xref target="Fig-SCHCArchiEx"/> shows an example of an IP/UDP/CoAP in an LPWAN network.</t>

<section anchor="the-static-context-header-compression"><name>The Static Context Header Compression</name>

<t><xref target="rfc8724">SCHC</xref> specifies an extreme compression capability based on a description
that must match on the compressor and decompressor side.
This description comprises a set of Compression/Decompression (C/D) rules.</t>

<t>The SCHC Parser analyzes incoming datagrams and creates a list of fields that it
matches against the compression rules.
The rule that matches is used to compress the datagram, and the rule
identifier (RuleID) is transmitted together with the compression residue to the decompressor.
Based on the RuleID and the residue, the decompressor can rebuild the original datagram and forward it in its uncompressed form over the Internet.
When no Rule matches the header, the No Compression Rule is used.
When several Rules match the header the implementation must choose one.
How it is done or based on which parameters is out of the scope of this document. SCHC compresses datagrams and there is no notion of flows.</t>

<t><xref target="rfc8724"/> also provides a Fragmentation/Reassembly (F/R) capability to cope
with the maximum and/or variable frame size of a Link, which is extremely constrained in the
case of an LPWAN network.</t>

<t>If a SCHC-compressed datagram is too large to be sent in a single Link-Layer PDU,
the SCHC fragmentation can be applied on the compressed datagram.
The process of SCHC fragmentation is similar to that of compression;
the fragmentation rules that are programmed for this Device are checked to find
the most appropriate one, regarding the SCHC datagram size, the link error rate,
and the reliability level required by the application.</t>

<t>The ruleID allows to determine if it is a compression or
fragmentation rule or any other type of Rule.</t>

<section anchor="schc-over-network-technologies"><name>SCHC over Network Technologies</name>

<t>SCHC can be used in multiple environments and multiple protocols.
It was designed by default to work on native MAC frames with LPWAN technologies such as LoRaWAN<xref target="rfc9011"/>, IEEE std 802.15.4 <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-schc-15dot4"/>, and SigFox<xref target="rfc9442"/>.</t>

<t>To operate SCHC over Ethernet, IPv6, and UDP, the definition of, respectively, an Ethertype, an IP Protocol Number, and a UDP Port Number are necessary, more in <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-schc-protocol-numbers"/>. In either case, there's a need for a SCHC Control Header that is sufficient to identify the SCHC peers (endpoints) and their role (device vs. app), as well as the SCHC Instance between those peers that the datagram pertains to.</t>

<t>In either of the above cases, the expectation is that the SCHC Control Header is transferred in a compressed form. This implies that the rules to uncompress the header are well known and separate from the rules that are used to uncompress the SCHC Data Header. The expectation is that for each stratum, the format of the SCHC Control Header and the compression rules are well known, with enough information to identify the SCHC Instance at that stratum, but there is no expectation that they are the same across strata.</t>

<section anchor="schc-over-ppp"><name>SCHC over PPP</name>

<t>The LPWAN architecture (<xref target="Fig-LPWANnetarch"/>) generalizes the model to any kind of peers.
In the case of more capable devices, a SCHC Device may maintain more than one end-point with the same peer, or a set of different peers.
Since SCHC does not signal the end-point in its datagrams, the information must be
derived from a lower layer point to point information.
For end-point, the SCHC end-point control can be associated one-to-one with a tunnel, a TLS SCHC Instance, or a TCP or a PPP connection.</t>

<t>For end-point, <xref target="I-D.ietf-schc-over-ppp"/> describes a type of deployment where
the C/D and/or F/R operations are performed between peers of equal capabilities
over a PPP <xref target="rfc2516"/> connection. SCHC over PPP illustrates that with SCHC,
the protocols that are compressed can be discovered dynamically and the
rules can be fetched on-demand using CORECONF messages Rules, ensuring that the peers use the exact same set of rules.</t>

<t>In that case, the SCHC end-point is derived from the PPP connection. This
means that there can be only one end-point per PPP connection, and that all the
flow and only the flow of that end-point is exchanged within the PPP connection.
As discussed in <xref target="EndPoints"/>, the Uplink direction is from the node that
initiated the PPP connection to the node that accepted it.</t>

<section anchor="schc-over-ethernet"><name>SCHC over Ethernet</name>
<t>Before the SCHC compression takes place, the SCHC Control Header showed in the <xref target="Fig-SCHC_hdr"/>, is virtually inserted before the real protocol header and data that are compressed in the SCHC Instance, e.g. a IPv6 in this figure.</t>

<section anchor="schc-over-ipv6"><name>SCHC over IPv6</name>
<t>In the case of IPv6, the expectation is that the Upper Layer Protocol (ULP) checksum can be elided in the SCHC compression of the ULP,
because the SCHC Control Header may have its own checksum that protects both the SCHC Control Header and the whole ULP, header and payload.</t>

<t>The SCHC Control Header between IPv6 and the ULP is not needed because of the Next Header field on the IPv6 header format.

<t>In the air, both the SCHC Control Header and the ULP are compressed.
The SCHC Instance endpoints are typically identified by the source and destination IP addresses. If the roles are well-known, then the endpoint information can be elided and deduced from the IP header.
If there is only one SCHC Instance, it can be elided as well, otherwise a rule and residue are needed to extract the SCHC Instance ID.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="schc-over-udp"><name>SCHC over UDP</name>
<t>When SCHC operates over the Internet, middleboxes may block datagrams with a next header that is SCHC. To avoid that issue, it would be desirable to prepend a UDP header before the SCHC Control Header as shown in figure <xref target="Fig-SCHC_hdr2"/>.</t>

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>In that case, the destination port can indicate SCHC as in an header chain, and the source port can indicate the SCHC Instance in which case it can be elided in the compressed form of the SCHC Control Header.
The UDP checksum protects both the SCHC Control Header and the whole ULP, so the SCHC and the ULP checksums can both be elided.
In other words, in the SCHC over UDP case, the SCHC Control Header can be fully elided, but the datagram must carry the overhead of a full UDP header.

<t>Typically, an LPWAN network topology is star-oriented, which means that all
datagrams between the same source-destination pair follow the same path from/to a
central point. In that model, highly constrained Devices (Dev) exchange
information with LPWAN Application Servers (App) through a central Network
Gateway (NGW), which can be powered and is typically a lot less constrained than
the Devices.
Because Devices embed built-in applications, the traffic flows to be compressed
are known in advance and the location of the C/D and F/R functions
(e.g., at the Dev and NGW), and the associated rules, can be pre provisioned in the system before use.</t>

<section anchor="schc-device-lifecycle"><name>SCHC Device Lifecycle</name>
<t>In the context of LPWANs, the expectation is that SCHC rules are associated with a
physical device that is deployed in a network. This section describes the actions
taken to enable an automatic commissioning of the device in the network.</t>

<section anchor="device-development"><name>Device Development</name>

<t>The expectation for the development cycle is that message formats are documented as a data model that is used to generate rules. Several models are possible:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>In the application model, an interface definition language and binary communication protocol such as Apache Thrift is used, and the parser code includes the SCHC operation.
This model imposes that both ends are compiled with the generated structures and linked with generated code that represents the rule operation.</t>
  <t>In the device model, the rules are generated separately. Only the device-side code is linked with generated code. The Rules are published separately to be used by a generic SCHC engine that operates in a middle box such as a SCHC gateway.</t>
  <t>In the protocol model, both endpoint generate a datagram format that is imposed by a protocol.
In that case, the protocol itself is the source to generate the Rules. Both ends of the SCHC compression are operated in middle boxes, and special attention must be taken to ensure that they operate on the compatible SoR, basically the same major version of the same SoR.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Depending on the deployment, the tools that generate the Rules should provide knobs to optimize the SoR, e.g., more rules vs. larger residue.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="rules-publication"><name>Rules Publication</name>

<t>In the device model and in the protocol model, at least one of the endpoints must obtain the SoR dynamically. The expectation is that the SoR are published to a reachable repository and versionned (minor, major). Each SoR should have its own Uniform Resource Names (URN) <xref target="RFC8141"/> and a version.</t>

<t>The SoR should be authenticated to ensure that it is genuine, or obtained from a trusted app store.
A corrupted SoR may be used for multiple forms of attacks, more in <xref target="Security"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="schc-device-deployment"><name>SCHC Device Deployment</name>
<!--
[//]: # (how to provision the GW with the security and the sortrefs for the new device?)
-->

<t>The device and the network should mutually authenticate themselves. The autonomic approach <xref target="RFC8993"/> provides a model to achieve this at scale with zero touch, in networks where enough bandwidth and compute are available.
In highly constrained networks, one touch is usually necessary to program keys in the devices.</t>

<t>The initial handshake between the SCHC endpoints should comprise a capability exchange whereby URN and the version of the SoR are obtained or compared.
SCHC may not be used if both ends can not agree on an URN and a major version.<br />
Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) <xref target="RFC8520"/> may be used for that purpose in the device model.</t>

<t>Upon the handshake, both ends can agree on a SoR, their role when the rules are asymmetrical, and fetch the SoR if necessary. Optionally, a node that fetched a SoR may inform the other end that it is reacy from transmission.</t>

<t>SCHC is sensitive to the rules that could be abused to form arbitrary long
messages or as a form of attack against the C/D and/or F/R functions, say to
generate a buffer overflow and either modify the Device or crash it. It is
thus critical to ensure that the rules are distributed in a fashion that is
protected against tempering, e.g., encrypted and signed.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) framework, which provides both a header compression mechanism and an optional fragmentation mechanism. SCHC has been designed with Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) in mind.</t>
      <t>SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored both in the LPWAN device and in the network infrastructure side. This document defines a generic header compression mechanism and its application to compress IPv6/UDP headers.</t>
      <t>This document also specifies an optional fragmentation and reassembly mechanism. It can be used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over the LPWAN technologies. Fragmentation is needed for IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC compression or when such compression was not possible, still exceed the Layer 2 maximum payload size.</t>
      <t>The SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms are independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which they are used. This document defines generic functionalities and offers flexibility with regard to parameter settings and mechanism choices. This document standardizes the exchange over the LPWAN between two SCHC entities. Settings and choices specific to a technology or a product are expected to be grouped into profiles, which are specified in other documents. Data models for the context and profiles are out of scope.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines how to compress Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) headers using the Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) framework. SCHC defines a header compression mechanism adapted for Constrained Devices. SCHC uses a static description of the header to reduce the header's redundancy and size. While RFC 8724 describes the SCHC compression and fragmentation framework, and its application for IPv6/UDP headers, this document applies SCHC to CoAP headers. The CoAP header structure differs from IPv6 and UDP, since CoAP uses a flexible header with a variable number of options, themselves of variable length. The CoAP message format is asymmetric: the request messages have a header format different from the format in the response messages. This specification gives guidance on applying SCHC to flexible headers and how to leverage the asymmetry for more efficient compression Rules.</t>

	 <t>   A framework called Static Context Header Compression and
   fragmentation (SCHC) has been designed with the primary goal of
   supporting IPv6 over Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies
   [RFC8724].  One of the SCHC components is a header compression
   mechanism.  If used properly, SCHC header compression allows a
   greater compression ratio than that achievable with traditional
   6LoWPAN header compression [RFC6282].  For this reason, it may make
   sense to use SCHC header compression in some 6LoWPAN environments,
   including IEEE 802.15.4 networks.  This document specifies how a
   SCHC-compressed packet can be carried over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.
   The document also enables the transmission of SCHC-compressed UDP/
   CoAP headers over 6LoWPAN-compressed IPv6 packets.

      <t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack.</t>
      <t>This document obsoletes RFC 7049, providing editorial improvements, new details, and errata fixes while keeping full compatibility with the interchange format of RFC 7049. It does not create a new version of the format.</t>

      <t>This memo specifies a component-based architecture for Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs). The goal of MUD is to provide a means for end devices to signal to the network what sort of access and network functionality they require to properly function. The initial focus is on access control. Later work can delve into other aspects.</t>
      <t>This memo specifies two YANG modules, IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP options, a Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) TLV, a URL, an X.509 certificate extension, and a means to sign and verify the descriptions.</t>
